- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @TheJambrose
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in really all things coding. I have a firm(ish) understanding of HTML/CSS3 with a growing confidence in both Python and JavaScript.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning JavaScript and Python.
- ðŸŽ“ All projects posted here are meant to help me track and practice what I learn. Semi-public space for increased accountabilty and the opportunity to get familiar with using Git.

Thanks for taking a look!
